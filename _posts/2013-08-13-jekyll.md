# Learning about Jekyll
  So I've been really enjoying Ruby on Rails development lately, and one of my most recent projects, required only a couple static pages.

I realized that Ruby on Rails might have been a bit of a.. how do you say.. powerhouse for just delivering a couple of static pages.  I did some searching, and that's when i discovered [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  An incredibly awesome, and minimalistic framework for creating static sites!  

This is _exactly_ what I needed.   I wasn't going to be using databases, ergo, never utilizing MVC, so why use rails.

I'm really coming to like Jekyll as i understand the in's and out's.  Considering I'm relatively new to rails - recently i've been learning [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), [YAML](http://yaml.org/), Embedded Ruby, HAML, I could go on.. Jekyll offers just a bit more confrustrusion to me, as now i have to grasp their templating language Liquid.
